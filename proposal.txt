Group Proposal:

This part of the project is to help you narrow down your idea, clarify its parts and make it easier to start coding.

The requirements are as follows:

[1]. Paragraph describing your app idea, What are you building? Who is it for?

[2]. An easily describable MVP, Remeber you have a limited amount of time to develop this project. What is the minimum you can get done on this project to meet the requirements and get a product in someone's hand?

[3]. User Story, What is a user going to do when they go to your site from the time they hit the landing page? What features do they need and which are optional?

[4]. Mind Map, What is the structure of your backend and front app going to look like? What routes, models, components, actions, and reducers will I need?
